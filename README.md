## Description

Our team's motivation for creating this application was to apply a culmination of our knowledge thus far in our bootcamp. That includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, third-party APIs, and most recently, Git. Each team member wanted to exercise their strengths and improve upon other skills. All of us used this project as an opportunity for teach-backs and, in turn, to learn more about areas of programming that we haven't explored deeply yet. 

In the beginning, our goal was to create an impressive end product that we could realistically use and be proud to display in our portfolios. The process of brainstorming, planning, and developing our app was important in our decidion making process. We decided that it was much better to deliver a polished MVP that we could knowingly develop given the time constraints, than overshoot our goal for the time and resources currently available to us. We gained invaluable experience working in Github collaboratively, using Git to push code made in branches, pull from the main repo, and merge pull requests to remain in sync with one another. Throughout development, we learned the importance of communication. While a team member works on one function, another person's area of the application may depend on variables defined in that function. Changing even the smallest lines of code could have large scale impacts. Each of us learned about different areas of coding from various team members. 

Despite realizing we could not add every bell and whistle we originally wanted, our team is proud to deliver the final app we have. CitySounds allows people to search by country for the top ten songs in 69 nations with a sleek, easy to navigate user interface.
